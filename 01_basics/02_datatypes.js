//string => "Hello, World!"
//boolean => true or false
//null => standalone value that represents "no value" or "empty"
//undefined => variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
//symbol => unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys



// object

console.log(typeof "Hello"); // "string"
